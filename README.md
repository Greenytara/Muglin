# 🧠 AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my AI project portfolio! Here, I showcase projects and research related to AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science, particularly in transportation and linguistics.

## 🚧 Predictive Modeling for Accident Risk in Hilly Terrains  
**Role:** Machine Learning Developer  
**Platform:** Ruchi AI Course  
**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Folium, Matplotlib  
**Timeline:**30 days

### 🔍 Project Overview  
Inspired by recurring road fatalities in Muglin, Nepal, this project aimed to predict accident-prone zones in hilly regions using AI. By analyzing environmental, geometric, and traffic-related factors, I developed a model to support early warning systems for transportation safety.

### ⚙️ Key Features & Contributions  
- 📊 Collected and cleaned multi-source data (weather, road geometry, traffic)  
- 🧩 Engineered features such as Curvature Index & Road-Weather Risk Score  
- 🧠 Trained machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- 🗺️ Visualized accident risk zones using Folium  
- 💡 Proposed real-time integration into highway alert systems

### 🌍 Real-World Impact  
This project simulates how AI can help prevent transportation-related fatalities in high-risk areas, especially in developing infrastructure settings like Muglin.
